
The program is done in visual studio.

In the item.cs, I constructed the item, which contains 3 attributes, and they are item name, quantity, price.
In the Form1.cs[Design], I designed the GUI. There are 3 textboxes to take in item, name, quantity. There are 2 listboxes, one is for displaying the added item,
the other is for displaying the totals. In addition, there are 2 buttons, one for adding things, and the other one is for cleaning existing data.
